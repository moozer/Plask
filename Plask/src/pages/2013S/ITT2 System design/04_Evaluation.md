sectionname: Evaluation

The course is evaluated as a part of the 2. semester exam.

Optional hand-ins

* 11/2-13 Hand-in exam question 1
* 4/3-13 Hand-in exam question 2
* 1/4-13 Hand-in exam question 3

Some comments about the optional question hand-ins:

* They will not be individually evaluated. 
* They serve a dual pupose. The first is to give the teacher an impression of the general level in class. The second is for each student to know his/her individual level.
* In the following lecture a volunteer will present the question.
